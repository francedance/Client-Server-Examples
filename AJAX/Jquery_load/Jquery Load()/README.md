## This example covers AJAXIFY Jquery's load() function to update HTML contents by retrieving .html file from a web server

**I made the website looks like a place where you can access different news**

**Logic:**

**If you click 'Today's News', it will then find 'today.html' file from a web server then load its content**

**This is useful since 'today.html' is separated from the main file. It saves space and it is easy to manage different contents**
