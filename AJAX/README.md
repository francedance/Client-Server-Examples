## This is the example of AJAXIFY Jquery's load() function to update HTML contents by retrieving .html file from a web server

**This will never work/run if you just open it on a web browser like the way use to see .html contents**

**You must! have some kind of server running in your computer to make it work!**

**I've basically used WAMP server (Windows Apache MySQL PHP) on my local machine and I recommend you to setup your own server locally**

**If you're interested in using WAMP server, AND it's FREE!, go here [WAMP server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) to download!**
